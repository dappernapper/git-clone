Ok for starters I may have lost some blog posts as I have recently forked a new repo so i will try to re-blog my old posts but we'll have to see :/

In other news me and Andrew have made good progress on our game but in the past few days the microbits coding website for java has completely crashed so for everyone coding has come to a stop. 

And p.s. I'm still annoyed that the micro:bits haven’t arrived yet…  >:(
