So yesterday we got our micro:bits. To be honest i didn't really need to read the manual because i already knew how it worked, and by the time Mr Keen told us how to compile things onto it, i was already playing my own game. Yesterday though I tested out the bluetooth functionality but it was slightly annoying that you can't use ios devices.
